# Solving-Quantum-Mechanics-Using-Python
In this project, I along with 3 group members solved the particle in a box problem computationally as part of University of Toronto's DEEP Computational Physics Challenge. To see the problem, feel free to view the "problem" pdf. In addition, along with the code, we created a slideshow to explain our process and findings. Check it out!
