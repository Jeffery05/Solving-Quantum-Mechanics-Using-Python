# Solving-Quantum-Mechanics-Using-Python
In this project, I along with 3 group members solved the particle in a box problem computationally as part of University of Toronto's DEEP Computational Physics Challenge. In the problem, we used Schrödinger equation and Python to graph the probability of a particle being in different areas of a box (assuming v=0 is inside the box and V = ∞ is outside). In addition, along with the code, we created a slideshow to present our process and findings. Check it out!
*Note: You will need to import numpy.
